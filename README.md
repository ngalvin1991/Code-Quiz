##User Story 
AS A coding boot camp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers

##Description
Code Quiz is a browser run application allowing the user to answer a variety of 
questions about coding in 60 seconds, if the user answers a question incorrectly
then the timer reduces by 10 seconds each time. 
Once all questions have been answered, or the user has run out of time, a score is 
generated. The user then has to put their initials (max 3 letters) into the text field, which will then save the score to the highscores page and the local storage.

##Installation 
The application will run on any web browser using the link above. 

##Usage 
Below are some example of the functionality of the webpage:
